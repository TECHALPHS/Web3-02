Implement a private blockchain network having two entities, patients who store their datain the blockchain and hospitals who can access the data ensuring data integrity andconfidentiality
.● Establish mechanisms for temporary access authorization, allowing doctors andhospitals to access patient records during appointment hours while respecting patientprivacy and consent. They should be able to update the data during this time.
● Integrate secured decentralized storage solutions to store patient data securely whilemaintaining accessibility and redundancy.
● Develop methods to verify patient and hospital identities, enabling secure entry into theprivate blockchain network and facilitating appointment scheduling, record updates, anddata submission.
● Show the version history of the patient data to show how many times the data gotchanged, who changed it, and what changes were made.
